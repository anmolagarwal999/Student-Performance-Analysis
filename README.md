# Student-Performance-Analysis

This is supposed to my first beginner's shot at data analysis. The task to be performed is a simple basic analysis of the dataset and to infer useful facts and patterns.
It also serves as a practice to get an idea about numpy syntax.

## Dataset

| Criteria | Description |
| :---        |    :----:   |
| gender |Gender of the student|
| race/ethnicity   | Race of the Student As Group A/B/C|
| parental level of education  | What is the education Qualification of Students Parent|
| lunch                         |                Whether the lunch is Standard type/Free lunch or Some discounted lunch|
| test preparation course        | Whether Student has Taken or not and Completed|
| math score                              | Scores in Maths|
| reading score                          | Scores in Reading|
| writing score                           | Scores in Writing


## Objective of this Analysis
To understand the how the student's performance (test scores) is affected by the other variables (Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch, Test preparation course).
## What to do in  Exploratory Data Analysis:
* To Analyse insights in the data set.
* To understand the connection between the variables and to uncover the underlying structure
* To extract the important Variables.
* To test the underlying assumptions.
* Provide Insights with Suitable Graphs and Visualizations.
* Write all your inferences with supporting Analysis and Visualizations.

## Files
The data was imported from the **.csv** file and the analysis can be found in the **.ipynb** file.
